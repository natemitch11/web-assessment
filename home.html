			<p>Welcome Savvy! you somehow found your way onto the infamous webpage of Captain Jack Sparrow! (please don't mention my last name around my parents... they haven't quite come to terms with me changing my last name) Today is your lucky day, because I am searching for pirates to join my crew! Some things that you can expect are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rum, just don't drink it all savvy, you like rum right?</li>
				<li>Mermaids... ok I may or may not be able to deliver on this one... but on the off chance we come across them again then you're welcome</li>
				<li>A small possibility I leave you with cursed gold... or undead on Davy Jones' boat, but is immortality really that bad of a payment?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I realize that those things may have deterred you more than motivated you to join savvy.... but, what do you have to lose? Today is the day you had the choice to join Captain Jack Sparrow!</p>
